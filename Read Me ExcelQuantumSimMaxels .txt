Excel Quantum Sim Maxels is a teaching tool that teaches the basics of the matrix maths
of Quantum Computing. 

For it to work it needs to be in directory C:\ExcelQuantum on the host computer.

Also to use the functionality of the file the MAXELS tab must be opened on the Excel
Ribbon.

After experimenting you can then build your own quantum circuits in Excel Quantum Sim V1.10;
this does not need to be in any particular place as it does not modify the Ribbon.

Enjoy. 

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
